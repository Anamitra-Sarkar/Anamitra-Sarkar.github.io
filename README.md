# Anamitra Sarkar's Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience as a software engineer. The portfolio is a modern, responsive single-page application built with React, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode:** A theme-switcher allows users to toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Interactive Background:** A dynamic, ambient background created with HTML5 Canvas adds a touch of visual flair.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The application is divided into several modular components, including:
    - Hero Section
    - Services
    - Projects
    - 3D Models
    - Engineering Portfolio
    - Skills
    - Experience
    - Interactive Playground
    - Footer
- **Smooth Animations:** Framer Motion is used to create smooth transitions and animations throughout the application.
